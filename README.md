# Quantum State Preparation

We define a Qiskit function which, given a complex vector of dimension 2^n, creates a circuit that produces the corresponding quantum state. We also provide some examples and explain our construction. 

This was a mini project that I completed during the Quantum Computing Bootcamp at [the Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) in summer 2025. The project was proposed by [Dr. Ákos Nagy](https://akosnagy.com/).
